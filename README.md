Welcome to hack mod. 

To run simply install spring and spring lobby then drop hackmod.sdd into the games directory and motherboard.sdd into the maps directory.

I didnt get a chance to implement all of the features and units into this game but theres a basic rts with some goofy looking units in it and im proud of it.

I'll work on getting a server up and running if anyone wants to try to play this with me.

Thanks for taking the time to read and if you would like to talk you can find me on twitter @schweig_
